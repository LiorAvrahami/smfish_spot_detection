End To End:
COMPLETE - find ROI's in segments, to deal with memory issues (1)

Deal With Class Imbalance:
- consider other loss functions (9)
- current solution, undersample roi's with no spot inside them (see conversation with chatgpt)

Dots Morpholagy:
- we assume a specific microscope resolution and some dot size distribution. (8)

ChannelLimitations:
- Alternative solutions: 
    - train five different networks for different static number of channels (4)
    - dynamic ammount of channels? (5)
    - automatic training tools for a specific number of channels with some spesific microscope: (6)
        - how it works: the user takes photos of around 3 backgrounds (7)
        - also the user can tag some points for his specific library in order to allow us to make synthetic points. (10)

Z stack limitation:
COMPLETE - crop around z (5~7 stacks) (13)

Architecture:
COMPLETE - give classifier ROI as image and ch coordinate (2)
COMPLETE - implement classifier with ROI coordinate input (11) {conditional CNN (cCNN) spli the first linear layer to three}
COMPLETE - comparison with synthetic tag for loss function: an roi is considered to contain a point if there exists a synthetic point with a distance of 2.5 from the roi's center. (12)

Training:
COMPLETE - train classifier on actual ROI's, not random points (3)

Benchmarks:
- RSFISH, bigfish, deepBlink, StarFish, airLocalize, fishquant

MoreData:
- Tal will talk to Liat regarding data from different microscope
- make data have many z-stacks (as much as possible)

QA:
- compare SpotOn results with two independent human observers using cohen's kappa statistic (make sure to only compare z stacks in the middle.)
