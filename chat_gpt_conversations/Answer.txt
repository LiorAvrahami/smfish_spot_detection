Sure, here's a basic example of how you might implement a conditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch. This example assumes you have some familiarity with PyTorch and its various utilities, like Dataloaders, Datasets, Tensor transforms, and CUDA operations.

import torch
from torch import nn

class ConditionalCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes):
        super(ConditionalCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 6, 5)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(6, 16, 5)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 5 * 5 + num_classes, 120)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(120, 84)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(84, num_classes)

    def forward(self, x, labels):
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 16 * 5 * 5)
        x = torch.cat((x, labels), dim=1) # concatenate the labels to the feature vector
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x

In this code:
- ConditionalCNN is a class representing the conditional CNN. It inherits from nn.Module, which is the base class for all neural network modules in PyTorch.
- The __init__ method initializes the layers of the CNN. num_classes is the number of classes in your dataset.
- The forward method defines the forward pass of the CNN. It takes as input a batch of images x and a batch of labels labels. The labels are concatenated to the flattened feature vector after the convolutional layers and before the fully connected layers. This is what makes the CNN "conditional".
Please note that this is a very basic example. Depending on your specific use case and dataset, you might need to adjust the architecture of the CNN (e.g., number and size of layers), the way you incorporate the labels into the network, and other factors. You should also remember to use appropriate methods for training your network.
